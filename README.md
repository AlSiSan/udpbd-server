# UDPBD Server

By Rick Gaiser

Cross-Compiled to Linux 32bit ARM7 by AlSiSan. 

Tested with Luckfox Pico (.img will be uploaded) to mount microSD directly.
Remember only Luckfox Pico Plus has an internal SPI NAND and ethernet port, otherwise you need to buy and solder the NAND and an Ethernet cable -in case you want to install the luckfox internally it is preferred-.
